                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi! my name is Kevin Coscarelli, I've been working as a Front-end/Full-stack engineer for 
                    the past nine years. I've worked for two major consulting companies in Argentina 
                    where I got the opportunity to work for a variety of clients such as Coca Cola, 
                    Disney, Sophos, Delphix, Thomas Cook and Reed among others and upon relocating to 
                    Denmark I worked at Lenus and later at Ageras Group. I've worked in both small 
                    and large international teams where I learned to implement agile workflow methodologies 
                    and to articulate different tech stacks, the most important of them being AngularJS, 
                    Angular, React, Backbone, Node, GraphQL, React-Native, Laravel, Docker and AWS.
                    During all of these years curiosity has been my main drive, both when I landed 
                    my first job and barely knew anything about software development, and today, when 
                    I see myself as a more seasoned developer but still remain eager to learn new things. 
                    I've grown as a developer to a point where I can not only make a positive contribution 
                    to everyday teamwork, but also, due to the many challenges I faced and the experience 
                    I got from them, I can help others in their work as well as contribute in product 
                    design and software architecture.
